* Quotes
"In here, they are safe and out there they are at risk -- it doesn't matter how
 tough they are in here, out there they are in danger because of where they come
 from."
   - Brian Hughes on how the streets are more dangerous than the gym, [[https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/28957747/gym-closed-coronavirus-leaves-local-boxers-no-place-go][Gym Closed]]

"Fear is like fire, you can make it work for you: It can warm you in the winter
 cook your food when you're hungry, give you light when you are in the dark. Let
 it get out of control and it can hurt you, even kill you... Fear is a friend of
 exceptional people."
   - Cus D'Amato
