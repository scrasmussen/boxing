* Quotes
"In here, they are safe and out there they are at risk -- it doesn't matter how
 tough they are in here, out there they are in danger because of where they come
 from."
   - Brian Hughes on how the streets are more dangerous than the gym, [[https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/28957747/gym-closed-coronavirus-leaves-local-boxers-no-place-go][Gym Closed]]

"Fear is like fire, you can make it work for you: It can warm you in the winter
 cook your food when you're hungry, give you light when you are in the dark. Let
 it get out of control and it can hurt you, even kill you... Fear is a friend of
 exceptional people."
   - Cus D'Amato

"Had I an enemy whom I wished to ruin, body and soul, I would ask no more than
 to turn him out into the company of pugilists and their clique, and the matter
 would be effected without delay."
   - The Spirit of the Times, 1832.

:Tyson-Fury:
earlier fights
Fury excels at using head position to keep his opponents from getting underneath
 him, or standing up tall to leverage uppercuts when they persist in trying, and
 handfighting to off-balance and create openings in their defenses
