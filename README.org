** <<Notes>>
*** Floyd Mayweather vs. Phillip N'dou <<11.1.2003>>
round 5 1:17 left, rest of round impressive as well
 - perfect example of using elbow from inside to misdirect a punch

*** Floyd Mayweather vs. Victoriano Sosa <<4.19.2003>>
Round 6, 0:56 left. Perfect example of Floyd's defence and reflexes.
Round 7, 1:17 left. Ha!
Between 7-8: montage of Floyd's defence

*** Floyd Mayweather vs. Jesus Chavez <<11.10.2001>>
Opponent tried Armstrong-esque pressure
*** Floyd Mayweather vs. C. Hernandez <<05.26.2001>>
Floyd went down from own punch
only time he's been down
*** Roger Mayweather vs. Pernell Whitaker <<3.28.1987>>
Round One: bell rung multiple, like ref didn't hear and "Sweet Pea" punched
 several times after the round ended. Roger went to the wrong corner.
Round Second: ref gets a left hook to the face.
Round Nine: Roger's pants are falling down, Sweet Pea pulls them all the way
 down. Roger knocks Sweet Pea to the ground and hits him while he's on his
 knees.
Ref doesn't do anything about anything.

*** Carlos Zarate vs Alfonso Zamora <<04.23.1977>>
Both fighters knock-out kings
pre-fight, the match had the highest combined knockout ratio ever
74 of 75 fights ended in a knockouts
*** Rocky Marciano vs. Don Cockell <<5.16.1955>>
American pressman Joe Williams wrote at the time: “Marciano violated practically
every rule in the book. He hit after the bell, he used his elbow and head,
several times punched below the belt and once hit Cockell while he was down. If
Cockell should get the idea that anything goes in the American ring, short of
wielding a knife or pulling a gun, you couldn’t blame him.”
*** Jack Johnson vs. Fireman Jim Flynn <<04.07.1912>>
Jim kept on headbutted Jack.
Sherrif jumps into the ring and stops the fight



* Boxing

:other-great-boxers:
Ezzard Charles:

 - one of greatest fighters of all time
 - speed, agility, fast hands, excellent footwork
Archie Moore:
 - longest reigning world light heavyweight champion
 - 3rd greatest pound-for-pound fighter all time
 - 4th greatest punchers of all time
Nicolino Locche "El Intocable" (the untouchable):
 - one of the finest defense boxers of all times
 - became light welterweight champion after Fuji refused to start 10th round,
   out of frustration because of exhaustion and inability to connect punches.
 - would sometimes take puffs of a cigarette between rounds.
James Toney:
 - shoulder roll technique, taught by Bill Miller who trained Ezzard Charles
 - exceptional counterpuncher and inside fighter, often preferred to fight off
   the ropes.
 - never stopped via stoppage
 - played Joe Frazier in the movie Ali
Sugar Ray Robinson
Shane Mosley !!
Felix Trinidad
Sugar Ray Leonard
Oscar de la Hoya
  - Derrell Coley, for that knockout
Lennox Lewis: britih heavyweight boxer
Manny Pacquiao

Naseem Hamed

Willie Pep: footwork

 - fought Sugar Ray Robinson who outweighed him by 15 pounds cause his manager
   didn't think the unknown guy would be good. Sugar Ray was fighting under a
   fake name so he could get paid
 - vs Sandy Saddler made him do tricks
Floyd Patterson: in picture with Willie Pep
Evander Holyfield:
 - "nodder": dropping the head below the opponent's as they advance
Sonny Liston

** Andre Ward
Ward vs Green, Ward sees inside training pay off
A few of his recent ones, will rewatch anyway ;)
vs. Sullivan Barrera : right catch and punch, defend right hit back, left hook
:vs-Dawson:
But what makes Ward so special is his combination of the classical methods and
 the new age thinking. The switching of stance is perhaps the biggest
 'new school' asset of his game, but his work specifically in the match with
 Dawson demonstrated a good deal of what has changed in boxing in the recent
 generation.

** Bernard Hopkins
   vs Joe Calzaghe?
     - Roach tell him to throw more combos, something Hopkins doesnt really do


** Canelo Alvarez
vs Trout    2013, DAZN SFL
vs Kirkland 2015, DAZN SFL
vs GGG      2017, DAZN SFL



** Floyd Mayweather
as well as Pacquiao and McGregor
DAZN: has De La Hoya, Hatton J. Marquez, Mosley, V. Ortiz, Cotto, Guerrero,
      Canelo, Maidana (2007-2014)
In mitt work, after combo will get hit in shoulder
  Floyd's foot position will indicate next punch thrown
After throwing a few punches, he'll start feinting/hesistating once you start
  flinching, this gives him a few deep breathes for next combo
vs Sosa: Round 6, 0:56 left. Perfect example of Floyd's defence and reflexes.

 - head movement (see Mike Tyson; Julio Cesar Chavez)

* Quotes
"In here, they are safe and out there they are at risk -- it doesn't matter how
 tough they are in here, out there they are in danger because of where they come
 from."
   - Brian Hughes, known as the Godfather of Manchester boxing, on how the
     streets are more dangerous than the gym, [[https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/28957747/gym-closed-coronavirus-leaves-local-boxers-no-place-go][Gym Closed]]

"When a boxer slides out from his corner at the sound of the bell, a trained eye
 can immediately ascertain the degree of his ability by the on-guard position he
 assumes."
   - John F. Walsh

"Fear is like fire, you can make it work for you: It can warm you in the winter
 cook your food when you're hungry, give you light when you are in the dark. Let
 it get out of control and it can hurt you, even kill you... Fear is a friend of
 exceptional people."
   - Cus D'Amato

"Adulation is a class A drug"
   - Barry McGuigan

"Before you mug a guy, you get him drunk."
   - Larry Holmes

"I don’t allow people to intimidate me, for no other reason than to set an
 example for my boxers."
   - Cus D'Amato

"Had I an enemy whom I wished to ruin, body and soul, I would ask no more than
 to turn him out into the company of pugilists and their clique, and the matter
 would be effected without delay."
   - The Spirit of the Times, 1832.

"Chess problems demand from the composer the same virtues that characterize all
 worthwhile art: originality, invention, conciseness, harmony, complexity, and
 splendid insincerity."
   - Vladimir Nabokov, Poems and Problems

"Challenge matches pretty much a stupid affair—you essentially have two men
 taking pride in refusing to broaden their horizons—but this one has a couple of
 nice moments."
   - Jack Slack

:Harold-Ledermans-Favourite:
 The best fight I ever saw without question, I was very fortunate to be a judge
 in the fight, between the then current WBC 122 pound champion Wilfredo Gomez,
and the reigning WBC 118 pound champion Lupe Pintor. It was absolutely beyond
belief. It was the semifinal to Wilfred Benitez and Tommy Hearns and to be
frank, after Gomez/Pintor everybody was drained, nobody could even watch Hearns
and Benitez. It took everything out of you. I’m virtually positive I had Gomez
ahead at the time of the knockout. What happened was nobody knocked each other
down. In the 14th round after going back and forth and back and forth Lupe Pintor fell down and Arthur Mercante Sr. counted him out. Interestingly enough Gomez walked out of the ring that night his faced looked like hamburger, Pintor walked out he didn’t have a scratch on him. Any of the great fights you’ve ever seen, Gomez and Pintor was just better.

=on UFC Fight Night: Moicano vs. The Korean Zombie=
Chris Weidman vs Machida
:LOOK-HERE:
Jones uses a great deal of double hand checking himself. This meant that the
 second Jones – Cormier fight took on that strange dynamic that Lyoto Machida
 vs Chris Weidman and Robbie Lawler vs Johnny Hendricks II did. Both men stood
 in striking range, checking their opponent’s offensive options and then tried
 to trick him with a crafty straight around the side or up the middle.
